# Benny Hill Video Converter

This is only my second application build with Angular 2, the first being a [simple chat application](https://github.com/OoogleBoogle/angfire2-chat), so still getting used to the Angular ropes. It's one of those applications that was born from a simple "I wonder if i could?" moment, that makes me giggle every time I look at it.

### Issues.

As a desktop only site this works fine. However, the YouTube API doesn't allow for increasing the speed of the video in mobile browsers and the custom music only plays in the dev version of chrome mobile. This, unfortunately, of kills the spirit of the app.

### Hosting.

I decided to host this on Firebase because of it's asset hosting, in a hope browsers wouldn't need to download the Yakety Sax tune.
